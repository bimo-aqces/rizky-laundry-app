# Rizky Laundry App

Rizky Laundry App is a web-based laundry management application created to support daily operations in a small laundry business. It helps organize customer data, transaction records, and expenses in a more structured and reliable way.

## Overview

This application was built to replace manual notes and scattered spreadsheets that often caused inconsistencies. The focus is on simplicity, speed, and clarity, so the system can be used comfortably in daily operational workflows without unnecessary complexity.

## Features

The app includes customer management, transaction recording for cash, transfer, and QRIS payments, as well as expense tracking. Dates are handled automatically to reduce input errors, and data can be exported to Excel for reporting or backup purposes.
The interface is designed to be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate.

## Tech Stack

Built using Next.js with the App Router and React for the frontend, Prisma ORM for database management, and PostgreSQL or SQLite as the database. Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

## Purpose

This project serves two purposes: as a practical solution for a real laundry business, and as a personal portfolio project to demonstrate full-stack web development skills in a real-world context.
